		<p>Even since I was a kid, I love to tell stories through drawing cartoon stories. And stories are all about the characters, and as the job of a storyteller was a tell the story of the character as if he or she once lived. So when I first learned to model abd animated a 3D character with 3ds Max in high school, I immidiately fell in love with 3D modelling. Because my characters were no longer flat on a piece of papter, but alive in a world that allow him or her to have a height, a weight and depth. When I first saw my character walking clumsily across the computer screen, I felt like I have finally meet my old pen friend. It was an incredible moment. </p>
